## Why Use Classic Shell?
 
Classic Shell is a popular and useful tool for Windows users who prefer the classic look and feel of older versions of Windows. It offers many options to customize the start menu, taskbar, and explorer to suit your preferences. You can change the menu style, layout, color, font, icons, and more. You can also enable or disable various features such as recent items, jump lists, search box, and so on.
 
Classic Shell is also compatible with Windows 10 and 8.1, which have a different start menu design than Windows 7. If you are not a fan of the tiles and apps that appear on the Windows 10 and 8.1 start menu, you can use Classic Shell to replace it with a more familiar and traditional start menu. You can also use Classic Shell to restore the missing start button on Windows 8.

## Other Ways to Customize the Start Menu
 
If you want to further customize the start menu beyond what Classic Shell offers, you can also use some other tools and methods. Here are some examples:

- You can use a third-party software such as [Start10](https://www.stardock.com/products/start10/) or [StartIsBack](https://www.startisback.com/) to change the start menu appearance and functionality. These tools have similar features as Classic Shell but may have different options and interfaces.
- You can use the built-in settings of Windows 10 and 8.1 to tweak some aspects of the start menu. For example, you can resize, rearrange, pin, unpin, group, or ungroup the tiles and apps on the start menu. You can also change the background color and transparency of the start menu.
- You can use a registry editor or a group policy editor to modify some hidden settings of the start menu. For example, you can change the number of items in the jump lists or disable the live tiles. However, this method is not recommended for beginners as it may cause errors or damage to your system if done incorrectly.

Whatever method you choose to customize your start menu, make sure you backup your system before making any changes. This way, you can restore your system in case something goes wrong.
